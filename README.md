Simple script i created for myself to (very roughly) calculate the time i have spent on a project from the timing of my commits. This only kinda works if you have a frequent approach to committing. (Managers: this should not be used to measure developer productivity, its really not accurate enough for that).

copy the py file to your project root and run it with `python estimate_coding_time.py` 

The project you copy it into does not have to be python, but you should have python installed to run the script.
